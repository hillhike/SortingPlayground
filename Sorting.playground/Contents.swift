//Purpose of this playground is to practice the sort algorithms including the following but not limited to
//Insertion sort
//Merge sort
//Heapsort
//Quicksort
//Counting sort
//Radix sort
//Bucket sort

//After writting and testing code for each write program to compare the times of sort for each algorithms; maybe even have them race to finish

//Gotta start somewhere
